            The history of Warsaw is very long and complicated. From the
            stronghold, through the royal city, total destruction to a modern
            metropolis. We encourage you to read a few words about the history
            of Warsaw. Pre-war history of Warsaw Initially it was a Masovian
            Dukes stronghold. Since XVI century that town was chosen as a
            parliamentary deliberation place. It’s here that our Polish
            democracy arosed. In Warsaw the Polish Kings were elected. At the
            end of XVI century our King Sigismunt III Wasa decided to move from
            Krakow to Warsaw. Warsaw became a royal city. Poland stopped to
            exist at the end of the XVIII century and our last King abdicated.
            The Partitioning time it was difficult time to Polish culture, art
            and history. Warsaw become a capital of the Great Duchy of Warsaw,
            later a capital of the Kongres Kingdom of Poland, and after the
            November Uprising was incorporated to Russian Partition. XIX century
            it was a stormy time. Warsawians fought for our independance during
            the Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising January Uprising and
            World War I. When Poland regain independence Warsaw became capital
            of II Polish Republic. The interwar period it was a time, when Poles
            and Warsawians were joyful of be free after the 123 years
            partitioning. However, it was a short time, only 20 years.

            War and post-war history of Warsaw During World War II, as early as
            September 1939, Warsaw was bombed, and many buildings feld in ruins.
            The area of the largest Jewish ghetto created in the General
            Government was razed to the ground during the Ghetto Uprising in
            1943. Warsaw residents did not give up without a fight. In occupied
            Poland, the Home Army grew in strength, the Polish Underground State
            was created, and finally the fight began. On August 1, 1944, the
            Warsaw Uprising broke out. After losing the fight, Hitler ordered
            that the stone on the stone from the city should not remain. Warsaw
            turned into a sea of ruins. Warsaw, like Fenix from the ashes, had
            to be reborn. It wasn’t that easy because the communist authorities
            wanted to rebuild the city in the social-realism style. It was in
            the 1950’s that the Palace of Culture and Science and the MDM
            district were built.

          <h6>Old Town</h6>
          <p>
            <img id="pic5" src="./imgs/5.jpg" alt="old-town" />
            Warsaw’s Old Town is the jewel in the Polish capital’s crown. It
            delights visitors with its colourful tenement houses and the unique
            atmosphere of its narrow streets. It is no wonder that it has been
            entered on the UNESCO World Heritage list! Be sure to visit the
            Royal Castle. It was there that the Constitution of 3 May was passed
            – the first in Europe and the second in the world. In the former
            home of Polish rulers, you will see the royal apartments, paintings
            by Rembrandt and canvases by Bernardo Bellotto, also known as
            Canaletto. On Castle Square stands the column of King Sigismund III
            Vasa, who in the 16th century moved the capital of Poland from
            Krakow to Warsaw. The oldest and the highest secular monument of the
            capital is an excellent landmark where locals in Warsaw often
            arrange to meet. The Old Town Square is the oldest and one of the
            most charming squares in Warsaw. It’s impossible not to fall in love
            with this place! It was laid out at the turn of the thirteenth and
            fourteenth centuries. Festivities and markets were organised here,
            but convicts were also executed. Although it is more than seven
            centuries old, its form has hardly changed. In the middle of the
            square stands a statue of the Warsaw Mermaid, the emblem and
            guardian of the city. If you are interested in the history of the
            city, visit the Museum of Warsaw or follow the Old Town Cellars
            Route. See also the barbican and the bell on Kanonia street, take a
            stroll along the old city walls and take a photo of the Vistula from
            the observation point at Gnojna Góra. Step into the cathedral, which
            houses the tombs of the medieval Mazovian princes, the last king of
            Poland Stanisław August Poniatowski, and the outstanding pianist and
            politician Ignacy Jan Paderewski. In the summer, the Old Town is
            full of café gardens and becomes a stage for cultural festivals. In
            winter, the Old Town and the Royal Route sparkle with beautiful
            illuminations.

          <h6>Lazienki Park</h6>

          <p>
            <img id="pic6" src="./imgs/6.jpg" alt="lazienki" />
            This vast garden is a favourite place for Varsovians where they go
            for long walks amid beautiful nature and architecture to rest from
            the hustle and bustle of the city. At the heart of the park is the
            summer residence of the last king of Poland – Stanisław August
            Poniatowski. The name of the complex comes from the
            seventeenth-century bathhouse of a Polish nobleman, rebuilt in the
            18th century into a palace. Here, in the Palace on the Island, King
            Stanisław August Poniatowski hosted his famous Thursday dinners, to
            which he invited scholars and poets to discuss the issues of the
            day. Today it is a museum where you can admire paintings from the
            royal collections. In the grounds of Łazienki you will also see an
            orangery, an amphitheatre, a court theatre, the Museum of Hunting
            and Horse-riding, the Myślewicki Palace and numerous free-standing
            sculptures. From spring to late autumn, the gardens are abundant
            with flowers. Squirrels and peacocks as well as ducks and swans are
            also among the park’s attractions. If you visit Warsaw in the
            summer, be sure to take part in one of the famous Chopin Concerts,
            which take place every Sunday at 12.00 and 16.00, from May 15 to
            September 25. In winter, take a walk along the Chinese Avenue, where
            you will see several-metre-long, luminous figures in period
            costumes.
          </p>
          <h6>Warsaw Uprising Museum</h6>
          <p>
            <img id="pic7" src="./imgs/7.jpg" alt="uprising museum" />
            A unique place that helps visitors understand contemporary Warsaw.
            This interactive museum commemorates the largest underground combat
            operation in German-occupied Europe during World War II. The 1944
            Warsaw Uprising changed forever the face of the Polish capital. The
            multimedia exhibition reflects the atmosphere of the Uprising, shows
            not only the military history of the 63 days of fighting and the
            everyday life of the civilian population, but also describes the
            post-war communist terror. Strolling along the granite pavement
            among the rubble of the destroyed capital, you will listen to the
            stories of the insurgents and see original exhibits from the
            uprising. You will understand how soldiers moving through the sewers
            felt and you will see a birds-eye view of the flattened city in the
            film City of Ruins. You can also take a selfie with a faithful
            replica of a Liberator B-24J. Drops with equipment for those
            fighting in Warsaw were made from such planes. At the heart of the
            museum is a steel monument that passes through all the floors of the
            building. Its walls are covered with the dates of each day of the
            uprising as well as bullet marks, and the sound of a beating heart
            that symbolises the life of Warsaw in 1944 comes from inside. In
            Freedom Park next to the museum, pay attention to the Memorial Wall.
            Nearly 11,000 names of soldiers killed in the Uprising are engraved
            on it. Be sure to also pay attention to insurgent murals by
            well-known Polish artists on the “Wall of Art”.

          <p class="p23"> <img id="pic23" src="./imgs/23.jpg" alt="table">
            If you want to try traditional Polish cuisine, stop counting your
            calories. Typical meals are very hearty and often contain a lot of
            meat. Just sampling them is enough to discover that they are really
            delicious and worth putting on a few ounces. The most recommendable
            dishes are: bigos, kotlet schabowy, pierogi and gołąbki (see below).
            Poles boast that their two basic products are bread and sausages.
            The most typical ingredients used in Polish cuisine are sauerkraut,
            beetroot, cucumbers (gherkins), sour cream, kohlrabi, mushrooms,
            sausages and smoked sausage. A meal owes it taste to the herbs and
            spices used; such as marjoram, dill, caraway seeds, parsley, or
            pepper. The most popular desserts are cakes and pastries. A shot of
            vodka is an appropriate addition to festive meals and help you to
            digest the food. Poland’s culture has always integrated elements
            from its neighbours, and there are also many recipes of Jewish
            origin. Nowadays the Polish menu is still changing, being influenced
            by various, sometimes exotic tastes. Apart from traditional
            restaurants specialising in Polish cooking, restaurants serving
            Italian, French and Asian foods are mushrooming in Poland’s cities,
            as well as vegetarian bars.

           The public transport network in Warsaw includes buses, trams, subway and SKM trains.
           In addition – on the basis of a daily or longer ticket – you can travel by KM and WKD trains .
          
           With Warsaw Public Transport (WTP) you can quickly and comfortably travel around the city and get to many cities neighboring with Warsaw. The easiest way to plan your trip is by using the journey planner.
          
           WTP vehicles can be used on the basis of time tickets (20-minute, one-time 75-minute, one-time 90-minute, group 75-minute), short-term tickets (daily, 3-day, weekend, group weekend) and long-term tickets (30- and 90-day). Time and short-term tickets have the form of a paper ticket, and long-term tickets are coded on the Warsaw City Card.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time and short-term tickets (in addition to those bought in ticket machines installed in WTP vehicles) should be validated immediately after entering the vehicle or at the subway gate. Tickets purchased in ticket machines in vehicles are already validated at the time of purchase. Tickets coded on cards must be activated by bringing closer to the validator or subway gate.

            WTP tickets can be purchased at ticket machines, selected kiosks and stores, Passenger Service Points and via mobile applications.

            In the Warsaw agglomeration there are two ticket zones. When choosing a ticket, please pay attention to whether the planned trip is limited to the first or second ticket zone.
